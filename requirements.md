GET	/api/v1/properties	Retrieve all properties
GET	/api/v1/properties/:id	Retrieve property by ID
PUT	/api/v1/properties/:id	Update property details
DELETE	/api/v1/properties/:id	Delete property (Host/Admin)
Input/Output Specifications

POST /api/v1/properties

Input (JSON)

    "id": 201,
    "title": "Cozy Apartment in Lagos",
    "location": "Lagos, Nigeria",
    "price": 45000,
    "host_id": 101
  }
}

Validation Rules

Title and location are required fields.

Price must be numeric and greater than zero.

At least one image URL must be provided.

Host must be authenticated and authorized.

Performance Criteria

CRUD operations should execute under 250ms.

Index location, price, and amenities for faster search queries.

Cache popular listings (top 10) with Redis to reduce DB load.

3. Booking Management Module
Objective

Enable guests to book properties, manage reservations, and track booking status.

Core Functionalities

Create and cancel bookings.

Validate booking availability.

Calculate total cost.

Track booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed).

API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/v1/bookings	Create a new booking
GET	/api/v1/bookings/:id	Retrieve booking details
GET	/api/v1/bookings/user/:id	Retrieve user‚Äôs bookings
PUT	/api/v1/bookings/:id/cancel	Cancel a booking
Input/Output Specifications

POST /api/v1/bookings

Input (JSON)

{
  "property_id": 201,

üõ†Ô∏è Summary of Best Practices
Area	Technique
Security	JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, HTTPS, role-based access control
Performance	Redis caching, indexed queries, async task queues
Scalability	RESTful microservices, containerized deployment (Docker, AWS ECS)
Monitoring	Use centralized logging (e.g., Winston + CloudWatch) and API metrics (Prometheus, Grafana)
