# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend

This project replicates the core backend logic of an Airbnb-like rental marketplace platform. It handles everything from user management and property listings to booking, payments, and reviews — built with scalability, security, and modularity in mind.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a **robust, secure, and scalable backend system** for an Airbnb Clone that supports:
- Guest and Host management
- Property listing and search
- Booking and payment workflows
- Review and notification systems
- Administrative monitoring and analytics

---

## 🏗️ System Overview

The backend provides RESTful API endpoints that power frontend applications. It manages:
- Data persistence using a relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- Secure authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)
- Integration with external services for payments, notifications, and storage

---

## 📋 Core Functionalities

### 👤 1. User Management
- Registration for **Guests**, **Hosts**, and **Admins**
- Secure authentication via JWT
- OAuth login (e.g., Google, Facebook)
- Profile management (photo, contact info, preferences)

### 🏠 2. Property Management
- Hosts can **add, edit, or delete listings**
- Properties include details such as title, location, price, amenities, and availability
- Search and filter capabilities for guests (location, price range, capacity, amenities)

### 📅 3. Booking Management
- Guests can book available properties
- System prevents overlapping bookings
- Track booking status (`Pending`, `Confirmed`, `Cancelled`, `Completed`)
- Allow booking cancellation by guests or hosts

### 💳 4. Payments
- Secure payment integration (Stripe, PayPal)
- Automatic payout to hosts post-booking completion
- Multi-currency support
- Real-time payment status tracking

### ⭐ 5. Reviews and Ratings
- Guests can rate and review completed bookings
- Hosts can respond to reviews
- Each review is linked to a specific booking

### 🔔 6. Notifications
- In-app and email notifications for booking updates, payments, and cancellations
- Delivered using external providers like SendGrid or Mailgun

### 🧑‍💻 7. Admin Dashboard
- Admins can manage users, properties, and transactions
- Monitor platform activity and performance
- Generate periodic reports

## 🧱 Database Schema

The database is designed for scalability and data integrity.

### Main Tables
- `users` – stores guest, host, and admin information  
- `properties` – manages property listings and availability  
- `bookings` – handles booking transactions and status  
- `payments` – tracks payment details and status  
- `reviews` – stores guest feedback and ratings  
- `notifications` – manages user notifications  

### Relationship Summary
- A **user** (Host) can have multiple **properties**
- A **guest** can make multiple **bookings**
- Each **booking** has a single **payment**
- Each **booking** can have one **review**
- **Notifications** are linked to **users**
